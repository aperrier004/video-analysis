# Project
Video analysis research project

Support for gripping by computer vision tools for amputees of the upper limbs, carriers of neuroprostheses.

Hypothesis: the direction of the gaze expresses the intention and makes it possible to know which object the user wants to grasp 

# Dataset
Dataset GITW_light
5 objects (Bowl, Can of Coca Cola, Milk Bottle, Rice, Sugar)
Manual annotation of the objects

# Goal
We are looking to study lifelong learning.
Given a model (CNN) trained to recognize objects, we try to adapt this model to new images arriving on the fly with the “Move-to-Data” method 

# Steps
## Step 1
Train the model on GITW_light
